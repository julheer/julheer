# Hi, good to see you!
Welcome to my GitHub account. Here I post the source codes of my projects.

## Let's get acquainted?
I live in the Russian Federation, but this does not prevent me from studying English. I practice JavaScript programming (using Node.JS) and also gradually learn TypeScript. Soon I plan to start developing games for Unity.

## Projects I have participated in:
  * Multifunctional Discord bot "Kerdokan"
  * Own game production team
  * MongoDB and Python: YouTube video playlist (RUSSIAN)
